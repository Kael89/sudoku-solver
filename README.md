# Sudoku Solver
Live system version: https://sudoku-solver-kael89.herokuapp.com/

This project is a web page which solves a Sudoku problem. The user enters the desired values in the Sudoku cells. Then they can hit the "Solve" button to display the result in the page.

The program also detects errors in the user input, e.g. same number in the same row. The page displays an alert in that case.
